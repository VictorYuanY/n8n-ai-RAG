**Knowledge Document: Understanding the Orderbook Report**

**I. Foundational Knowledge: Core Concepts & Metrics**

This section outlines the fundamental concepts, definitions, and principles essential for understanding the company's order book and related business dynamics. These are generally independent of specific report formats.

*   **1.1. Core Concepts:**
    *   **Orderbook:** The cumulative dollar value of confirmed customer orders slated for shipment within a specific calendar year. It includes both orders already shipped within that target year and orders confirmed but not yet shipped.
    *   **Lead Time:** The duration between when an order is confirmed and when it is shipped/delivered. This varies significantly by business unit and customer type.
        *   *General Average:* Roughly 100 days for some core operating groups.
        *   *Onshore Businesses:* Can have effective lead times (from initial bulk commitment to final customer delivery) of up to 6 months due to multi-stage processes.
    *   **Year-over-Year (YoY) Comparison:** A method of comparing performance in a given period against the corresponding period in the previous year. Crucial for identifying trends and growth/decline.
    *   **Order Types & Stages (especially for Onshore Businesses):**
        *   **Bulk Order:** An initial, often early, commitment from a customer regarding order quantity and pricing.
        *   **Allocation:** A specific instruction from a customer to the company to ship goods (that are already held in an onshore warehouse) to a final destination.
    *   **Business Model Types:**
        *   **Agency Model:** The company acts as an agent connecting factories/vendors (often in Asia) with customers (often in US/Europe), typically involving FOB (Free on Board) shipments. SCS primarily operates this way.
        *   **Onshore Model:** The company imports goods and holds them in company-controlled warehouses within the target market, awaiting final customer shipping instructions (allocations). The "Markets" segment largely follows this.
    *   **Forecasting & Budgeting:**
        *   **Budget:** The initial financial target for turnover for a year.
        *   **Re-forecasts (e.g., 1QR, 2QR, 3QR):** Formal updates to the annual financial target, typically occurring quarterly. "1QR" means one quarter of actual results plus a forecast for the remaining nine months.
    *   **Market Dynamics:**
        *   **Panic Buying:** A surge in orders driven by fear of future scarcity, significant price increases, or supply chain disruptions (e.g., observed in 2022 due to port congestion).
        *   **Inventory Glut:** A situation where businesses hold excessive levels of inventory compared to demand, often following a period of overbuying (e.g., observed in 2023).
        *   **Market Bifurcation:** A trend where demand grows at the very low-price (discounter) and luxury ends of the market, while the mid-range segment experiences a squeeze.

*   **1.2. Key Metrics (Conceptual Definitions):**
    *   **Turnover:** The total sales revenue generated in a period.
    *   **Order on Hand (OOH) / Weekly Orders:** The net new order value booked in a specific, short timeframe (typically a week).
    *   **Rolling Period Orders:** The sum of net new order values booked over a defined rolling period (e.g., 4 weeks) to smooth out short-term volatility.
    *   **Cumulative Orders:** The year-to-date total value of all orders booked for a specific order book year.
    *   **Filled Rate:** A percentage indicating how much of a target turnover for a year is covered by the cumulative order on hand at a specific point in time.
        *   `Filled Rate = (Cumulative Order on Hand at a specific week) / (Target Turnover for that full year)`
        *   The "Target Turnover" is the Budget for the current year (or subsequent re-forecasts) and the Actual Final Turnover for past completed years.

*   **1.3. Glossary of Fundamental Terms:**
    *   *(Refer to terms defined in 1.1 and 1.2 above)*

**II. Report Interpretation Guide: Navigating the *Current* Standard Reports**

This section explains how to read and interpret the specific visual representations (charts and tables) of the data as they currently exist in the standard weekly order book reports you've provided.

*   **2.1. General Report Information (Across Multiple Report Views):**
    *   **Report Date/Week:** Reports are typically dated "As of [Date]" and reference a "Week No." (e.g., Week 19).
    *   **Currency:** Values are typically in USD Millions.
    *   **Legend (for charts):** Explains what different colored lines or symbols represent (e.g., different years).

*   **2.2. Interpreting "Year-over-Year % Change" Line Charts (e.g., "2025 Orderbook" - Image 1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To visually track the YoY percentage change in the cumulative order book for different business segments and the Group Total.
    *   **X-Axis (Weeks):** Represents the week number of the order book year, typically starting from around week 40 of the preceding year.
    *   **Y-Axis (Percentage %):** Shows the YoY percentage change in cumulative order book value. Positive values indicate growth; negative values indicate decline.
    *   **Colored Lines:** Each line represents the YoY % change of a specific order book year compared to its preceding year.
        *   Example Legend: Orange (Δ% 2025 vs 2024), Green (Δ% 2024 vs 2023), etc.
    *   **Data Labels at End of Lines:**
        *   *For the current year line (e.g., Orange):* The value at the current week (e.g., `(9.9%)` at Wk 19) is the current YoY performance.
        *   *For past year lines (e.g., Green, Red, Blue):* Values shown near week 51/52 represent the *final* YoY performance for those respective comparison years.
    *   **Chart Sections:**
        *   **"Group Total":** Aggregated company-wide performance.
        *   **Segment Charts (Apparel, Home, LF Markets USA, etc.):** Breakdown by specific business units.

*   **2.3. Interpreting the "Summary Table" (e.g., "2025 Orderbook As of May 12, 2025" - Image 2):**
    *   **Structure:** Divided into SCS and Markets, then further by business units.
    *   **i) Weekly Orders:**
        *   **Columns (2023, 2024, 2025):** Net new order value booked *in the current week* for that respective year.
        *   **"25 Vs 24 Δ%":** Percentage change in weekly orders (2025 current week vs. 2024 corresponding week).
    *   **ii) Rolling 4-week Orders:**
        *   **Columns (2023, 2024, 2025):** Sum of net new orders booked in the *past four weeks* for that respective year.
        *   **"25 Vs 24 Δ%":** Percentage change in rolling 4-week orders (2025 period vs. 2024 corresponding period).
    *   **iii) Cumulative Orders:**
        *   **Columns (2023, 2024, 2025):** Total order book value *year-to-date* (up to the current week) for that respective year.
        *   **"25 Vs 24 Δ%":** YoY percentage change in the cumulative order book (2025 YTD vs. 2024 YTD). This should align with the main YoY % Change Line Charts.
    *   **Segment Definitions (as presented in this table):**
        *   **SCS (Supply Chain Solutions):** Includes Apparel, Home.
        *   **Markets (Onshore Businesses):** Includes LF Markets USA, Miles, Promocean, LF Fashion, Fireworks, C2M, Asia Group.

*   **2.4. Interpreting "Global Orderbook Filled Rate" Line Charts (e.g., Image 3 - Group & Segments):**
    *   **Purpose:** To visually track how much of the targeted annual turnover has been "filled" by the cumulative order book, week by week.
    *   **X-Axis (Weeks):** Week number.
    *   **Y-Axis (Percentage %):** Filled Rate.
    *   **Colored Lines:** Each line represents a specific order book year (e.g., 2025, 2024, etc.).
    *   **Data Labels on Lines (e.g., "64.6%" on 2025 Group Total):** Shows the filled rate at the current week.
    *   **Embedded Table ("FR" and "25 Δ Vs"):**
        *   **"FR" (Filled Rate):** Shows the filled rate for each year *at the current report week* (e.g., Week 19).
        *   **"25 Δ Vs" (2025 Delta Versus):** Shows the *difference in percentage points* between the 2025 filled rate (at current week) and the filled rate of the compared past year (at its corresponding week).
            *   Calculation: `(2025 Filled % at Wk X) - (Past Year Filled % at Wk X)`.
            *   Example (Group Total vs 2024 at Wk 19): `64.6% - 75.4% = -10.8%` (Note: table shows -10.9%, slight rounding difference from manual calc is possible).

*   **2.5. Interpreting the "Top 10 Customers" Table (e.g., Image 4):**
    *   **Ranking Note:** Customers are ranked based on their 2025 Budgeted Turnover volume.
    *   **Orderbook Section:**
        *   **2024, 2025:** Cumulative order book value with the customer at the current week for each year.
        *   **25 Vs 24 Δ%:** YoY % change in the customer's order book value.
    *   **Filled % Section:**
        *   **2024:** Filled rate for the customer at the current week in 2024 (2024 Wk X OB / 2024 Final Actual Turnover).
        *   **2025:** Filled rate for the customer at the current week in 2025 (2025 Wk X OB / 2025 Budgeted Turnover).
        *   **25 Vs 24 Δ%:** This is a **percentage change of the filled rate percentages**, indicating the change in the *pace* of filling.
            *   Calculation: `((2025 Filled %) - (2024 Filled %)) / (2024 Filled %)`
            *   Example (Grand Total): `(65.1% - 75.5%) / 75.5% = -13.8%`.
    *   **Turnover Section:**
        *   **24 Act:** Actual final turnover achieved with the customer for the full year 2024.
        *   **25 Bud:** Budgeted turnover target for the customer for the full year 2025.
        *   **25 Vs 24 Δ%:** Percentage change between the 2025 budget and 2024 actual turnover (targeted growth/decline).

*   **2.6. Interpreting "Global Orderbook Fill Rate for Top 5 Customers" Line Charts (e.g., Image 5):**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a visual deep dive into the filled rate progression for individual Top 5 customers.
    *   **Structure:** Each customer has their own chart, following the same format as the global/segment filled rate charts (see 2.4), including the embedded table showing "FR" at the current week and "25 Δ Vs" (difference in percentage points).

**III. Timeful Knowledge: Performance Analysis, Historical Context & Evolving Narratives**

This section applies the foundational knowledge and report interpretation guide to analyze specific data, providing current performance insights, historical context, and highlighting evolving narratives.

*   **3.1. Current Reporting Period Analysis (As of Week 19, May 12, 2025 - based on provided images)**

    *   **3.1.1. Overall Group Performance:**
        *   **YoY Orderbook:** Down 9.9% (Group Total).
        *   **Filled Rate:** 64.6% for 2025, significantly behind 2024 (75.4%), 2023 (73.3%), and 2022 (83.3%) at Week 19. The difference vs 2024 is -10.8 percentage points.
        *   **Pace of Filling (Top 10 Table):** The filled rate pace is -13.8% YoY, indicating a slower booking rhythm relative to target compared to last year.
        *   **Turnover Target:** 2025 budget aims for +4.4% growth over 2024 actuals.
        *   **Key Concern:** Significant lag in order book and fill rate against a growth budget.

    *   **3.1.2. Segment-Level Performance Highlights & Concerns (YoY % Change & Filled Rate):**
        *   **Apparel (SCS):** Orderbook significantly down. Filled rate at 53.1% (Wk 19), well below historical levels for this point.
        *   **Home (SCS):** Orderbook showing positive growth (Table: +7.9%). Filled rate at 70.9% (Wk 19), appearing relatively on track.
        *   **LF Markets USA:** Orderbook slightly down (Table: -0.6%). Filled rate at 77.7% (Wk 19), seems okay.
        *   **Miles:** Orderbook up (Table: +13.8%). Filled rate strong at 87.2% (Wk 19).
        *   **Promocean:** Orderbook up (Table: +1.9%). Filled rate at 58.8% (Wk 19), appears to be catching up.
        *   **LF Fashion:** Orderbook down (Table: -4.1%). Filled rate at 58.0% (Wk 19); had a strong start but has tailed off recently.
        *   **Fireworks:** Very high filled rate (90.9% at Wk 19), typical for its seasonal nature.
        *   **C2M:** Orderbook up significantly but from a small base. Filled rate at 47.5% (Wk 19).

    *   **3.1.3. Top Customer Performance Insights (Wk 19, 2025):**
        *   **Action Service:**
            *   Budgeted Turnover: +34.7% YoY.
            *   Orderbook: +30.2% YoY.
            *   Filled Rate (Chart): 87.4% (vs 90.4% in 2024). Pace slightly behind (-3.3% in table). Strong overall.
        *   **Kohl's:**
            *   Budgeted Turnover: -62.2% YoY.
            *   Orderbook: -68.4% YoY (even weaker than budget).
            *   Filled Rate (Chart): 68.0% (vs 81.3% in 2024). Pace significantly worse (-16.4% in table). Decelerated sharply after an initially okay start to the fill rate curve.
        *   **AEO:**
            *   Budgeted Turnover: +0.4% YoY.
            *   Orderbook: -3.7% YoY.
            *   Filled Rate (Chart): 60.2% (vs 62.8% in 2024). Pace slightly behind (-4.1% in table).
        *   **ASDA:**
            *   Budgeted Turnover: +7.1% YoY.
            *   Orderbook: -9.6% YoY.
            *   Filled Rate (Chart): 55.1% (vs 65.3% in 2024). Pace significantly behind (-15.6% in table). Awaits potential buying burst.
        *   **Ross Procurement:**
            *   Budgeted Turnover: +3.3% YoY.
            *   Orderbook: -20.9% YoY.
            *   Filled Rate (Chart): 48.2% (vs 63.0% in 2024). Pace significantly behind (-23.4% in table).
        *   **"Others" Category:**
            *   Budgeted Turnover: +10.8% YoY.
            *   Orderbook: -19.4% YoY (steep decline).
            *   Filled Rate Pace (Table): -27.6% YoY (very poor). Widespread issue beyond Top 10.

*   **3.2. Key Historical Narratives & Their Impact on Orderbook Trends:**

    *   **3.2.1. The 2022 "Panic Buying" Year:**
        *   **Cause:** Major global supply chain disruptions, port congestion (especially US).
        *   **Effect:** Customers placed orders exceptionally early to secure inventory.
        *   **Observation in Reports:** Many segments (esp. Group Total, Apparel, Ross) show a significantly higher filled rate "hump" in H1 2022. Group Total reached 83.3% filled by Wk 19. Order booking pace slowed in H2 2022 as issues eased and overstocking became apparent.
    *   **3.2.2. The 2023 "Inventory Glut" Year:**
        *   **Cause:** Carry-over of excess inventory from 2022's overbuying.
        *   **Effect:** Customers focused on selling through existing stock, leading to cautious new ordering.
        *   **Observation in Reports:** Filled rates in early 2023 were often slower than 2022, reflecting this cautiousness.
    *   **3.2.3. Kohl's Strategic Shift (Ongoing from late 2024/early 2025):**
        *   **Nature of Shift:** Kohl's decided to reduce reliance on the company as an agent for some private label sourcing, opting for direct engagement with certain vendors/countries.
        *   **Impact:** Massive reduction in budgeted turnover and actual order book for 2025.
        *   **Observation in Reports:** The 2025 Kohl's filled rate chart shows an initial alignment with past years, then a sharp deceleration as the "phasing out" of business takes effect. This drop is not purely organic market performance but a conscious strategic change by the customer.
    *   **3.2.4. Action Service Growth Story:**
        *   **Context:** European discounter (Home & Accessories segment).
        *   **Trend:** Consistent, spectacular YoY growth in turnover and order book. Strong, early booking patterns.
        *   **Strategy Driver:** Aligns with Home segment's strategy of targeting discounters and value items, with scalable sourcing (often China-focused).
    *   **3.2.5. US Mid-Range Retail Weakness (Multi-year trend impacting Apparel):**
        *   **Context:** Post-COVID, the US retail market, especially mid-range department stores and apparel retailers (e.g., AEO, Express, historically Kohl's for this company), has faced challenges due to changing consumer behaviors and market bifurcation (growth at discounter/luxury ends).
        *   **Impact:** Contributed to the multi-year decline in the Apparel segment (SCS), which has a strong US customer focus.
    *   **3.2.6. ASDA's Buying Patterns:**
        *   **Observation:** Historically shows "bursts" in filled rate, possibly linked to specific buying trips or seasonal windows (e.g., Wk 20-25 in 2024). The 2025 Wk 19 filled rate is lower, potentially indicating such a burst is still to come or a shift in timing.

*   **3.3. Summary of Key Insights & Strategic Questions (from Week 19, 2025 analysis):**
    *   *(This section consolidates the insights derived from applying the report interpretation guide to the current data, many of which are detailed in 3.1.1 - 3.1.3 and contextualized by 3.2. The strategic questions raised in the previous interaction are all highly relevant here.)*

    *   **Key Insights Summary:**
        1.  **Overall Underperformance:** Significant lag in 2025 order book and filled rate vs. prior years and vs. a growth budget.
        2.  **Kohl's Strategic Impact:** A primary driver of the downturn, but even the reduced target seems challenging based on current order book.
        3.  **Broad-Based Weakness:** The "Others" customer category shows even steeper declines, indicating issues beyond just top accounts.
        4.  **Action Service & Home Segment as Bright Spots:** Demonstrating resilience and growth through specific strategies.
        5.  **Apparel Segment Under Pressure:** Multiple headwinds including Kohl's shift and general market conditions.
        6.  **Timing vs. Trend Uncertainty:** For some customers (e.g., ASDA, LF Fashion), it's unclear if current performance is a timing issue or a new negative trend.
        7.  **Historical Volatility Impact:** 2022/2023 extremes make YoY comparisons complex.

    *   **Key Strategic Questions:**
        1.  How can the order booking gap be closed to meet the 2025 budget, especially for "Others" and underperforming (non-Kohl's) Top 10?
        2.  What is the realistic final outlook for Kohl's in 2025, and what are the long-term plans to replace this volume in Apparel?
        3.  What are the root causes for the severe underperformance in the "Others" customer segment?
        4.  How can successes from Action Service and the Home segment be leveraged or replicated elsewhere?
        5.  What actions are needed to clarify whether recent slowdowns for customers like ASDA or LF Fashion are temporary or systemic?
        6.  Based on current trends, what is the re-assessed probability of achieving the overall 2025 budget, and what are the key risks/opportunities for the remainder of the year?
        7.  What is the specific nature of the recent tailing-off for LF Fashion's filled rate after a strong start?

# Knowledge Base: Querying Enterprise Sales & Order Data (Databricks SQL)

**Version:** 1.8
**Last Updated:** 2025-07-29

## 1. Objective

This document guides users on executing read-only SQL queries against the enterprise data warehouse (Databricks instance) to retrieve business metrics. It focuses on:

*   Historical Orders/Shipments (Order on Hand - OOH, Actuals)
*   Budget/Forecast Data
*   Calculating derived metrics like Fill Rates.

Primary tables involved are `fna.fna_bronze.vw_gob_spencerorderbook` (historical) and `lft.bronze.dds_frwshp_jedox` (budget/forecast).

## 2. Standard Business Conventions & Terminology

These conventions **MUST** be followed in all business interactions:

### 2.1. OOH (Order on Hand) Definition

*   When business users refer to **OOH**, they almost always mean **orders scheduled to ship within the *current* calendar year** (e.g., 2025 as of the last update date), even if those orders were placed in a prior year or are part of snapshots containing next-year data.
*   **Implementation:** Filter queries accordingly, typically using `SHIP_YEAR = ?current_year?` (e.g., `SHIP_YEAR = 2025`) on the `vw_gob_spencerorderbook` table for standard OOH analysis.

### 2.2. Common Terminology/Aliases

*   **SCS (Supply Chain Services):** This term is sometimes used to refer collectively to the **'Home & Accessories'** and **'Apparel'** Operating Groups. Be aware of this alias when interpreting requests or filtering data. (See Appendix 8 for breakdown dimensions related to these OGs).

### 2.3. Notes on formatting
*   **Structure:** Use prose for context, bullet points for details.
*   **Monetary Values:**
    *   Millions: `USD #,##0.0m` (e.g., USD 1,234.5m)
    *   Thousands: `USD #,##0.0k` (e.g., USD 1,234.5k)
*   **Percentages:** `0.0%` (e.g., 25.7%).
*   **Negative Numbers:** Use descriptive words for clarity:
    *   `Loss of USD 1.0m` (instead of `- USD 1.0m Profit`)
    *   `Decrease of 5.0%` or `Decline of 5.0%` (instead of `- 5.0% Change`)


## 3. Key Data Sources (Tables)

### 3.1. Historical Orders/Shipments

*   **Table:** `fna.fna_bronze.vw_gob_spencerorderbook`
*   **Content:** Primary source for historical order book (OOH) and actuals/shipped data. Contains weekly snapshots of the order book state.
*   **Key Use:** Analyzing OOH trends, shipped values, historical comparisons.
*   **Important Considerations:** Subject to aggregation best practices (Section 6.6) and potential data retrieval limitations (Section 7.6).

### 3.2. Budget/Forecast Data

*   **Table:** `lft.bronze.dds_frwshp_jedox`
*   **Content:** Contains Budget or Forecast data (e.g., Net Sales targets). Typically aggregated at a higher level (e.g., yearly, monthly) than the weekly snapshot table.
*   **Key Use:** Providing the denominator for Fill Rate calculations, comparing OOH/Actuals against targets.

## 4. Key Data Elements (Columns)

### 4.1. Common Dimensions (for Filtering/Grouping)
*   **`SHIP_YEAR`**: Year the order is scheduled to ship or shipped (in `vw_gob_spencerorderbook`). Crucial for filtering OOH for a specific year (Section 2.1, 5.5).
*   **`REPORT_OPERATING_GROUP_DESC_UPDATED`**: Business unit description (e.g., 'Home And Accessories', 'Apparel').
    *   *Note:* 'Home And Accessories' and 'Apparel' are sometimes collectively referred to as 'Supply Chain Services (SCS)'. See Appendix 8 for known dimensions within these groups.
*   **`REPORT_OPERATING_GROUP_CODE_UPDATED`**: Code for the operating group (often used in standard exclusions, see Section 5.1).
*   **`REPORT_DIVISION_DESC`**: Division description within an Operating Group (e.g., 'AHA DIVISION'). See Appendix 8 for applicability.
*   **`REPORT_CORPORATE_CUSTOMER_NAME`**: Name of the customer account (e.g., 'ACTION SERVICE & DISTRIBUTIE B.V.').
    *   *Note:* High cardinality. Requires SQL Aggregation (Section 6.6). Subject to potential data retrieval limits (Section 7.6). See Appendix 8 for specific warnings and handling guidance (Section 6.7).

*   **`YEAR`**: Year in the Jedox table (`dds_frwshp_jedox`). Corresponds to `SHIP_YEAR`.
*   **`WEEK_NO`**: The snapshot week number (1-53, or special values like 99 for latest) in `vw_gob_spencerorderbook`. Identifies the specific weekly snapshot. See Section 5.4 regarding filtering.
*   **`SCENARIO`**: Type of data in `dds_frwshp_jedox` (e.g., 'Budget', 'Actual'). Used in Fill Rate calculations (Section 6.2).
*   **`SOURCE`**: Data source system identifier (used in standard exclusions, Section 5.1).

### 4.2. Common Metrics (for Calculation)

*   **`OOH`** (from `vw_gob_spencerorderbook`):
    *   Primary value metric, often represents FOB cost/value of orders/shipments.
    *   Use `SUM()` with `GROUP BY` in SQL for aggregation (**Mandatory** - See Section 6.6).
    *   Use high-precision types for aggregation (e.g., `CAST(SUM(OOH) AS DECIMAL(38, 10))`) in SQL.
*   **`NET_SALES`** (from `dds_frwshp_jedox`):
    *   Primary value metric for Budget/Forecast/Actuals.
    *   Use `SUM()` with `GROUP BY` in SQL for aggregation.

## 5. Standard Query Practices & Filters

Apply these filters to `vw_gob_spencerorderbook` queries unless explicitly asked to do otherwise. Adapt for `dds_frwshp_jedox` based on available columns.

### 5.1. Snapshot Week Filter

*   Target a specific snapshot week:
    ```sql
    -- In WHERE clause
    WEEK_NO = ?target_week? -- e.g., WEEK_NO = 15
    ```
*   Exclude week 99 unless specifically needed (it often represents a non-standard latest view):
    ```sql
    -- In WHERE clause (if querying across weeks)
    WEEK_NO < 99
    ```
*   if user say current week, that means current ISO week number. For example, 2025/7/23 is ISO Week Number of 30. 
    ```sql
    -- In WHERE clause 
    WEEK_NO = weekofyear(current_date())
    ```

### 5.2. Ship Year Filter

*   Focus analysis on a specific shipment year (essential for OOH, YoY, Fill Rate):
    ```sql
    -- In WHERE clause
    SHIP_YEAR = ?target_ship_year? -- e.g., SHIP_YEAR = 2025
    ```


## 6. Common Query Patterns & Calculations

This section outlines common analysis types and calculations. **Always apply Aggregation Best Practices (Section 6.6) and be aware of potential Data Retrieval Limits (Section 7.6) when querying `vw_gob_spencerorderbook`.**

### 6.1. Determining the Latest Snapshot Year and Week (Single Query Method)

*Purpose: Find the most recent snapshot year and the corresponding latest week number (excluding Week 99) available in the `vw_gob_spencerorderbook` table using a single, efficient query. This is often needed to establish the 'current' point-in-time for OOH analysis.*

**SQL Query:**
``` sql
SELECT
    CAST(SUBSTR((SHIP_YEAR), 1, 4) AS INT) AS latest_year,
    WEEK_NO AS latest_week
FROM fna.fna_bronze.vw_gob_spencerorderbook
WHERE
    WEEK_NO < 99
ORDER BY
    latest_year DESC,
    latest_week DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Explanation:**

*   This query filters exclude the non-standard `WEEK_NO = 99`.
*   Crucially, it orders the results first by ship year in descending order (`latest_year DESC`) and then by week number in descending order (`latest_week DESC`).
*   `LIMIT 1` ensures that only the very top row after ordering is returned, which corresponds to the latest week within the latest year meeting the filter criteria.
*   The result will be a single row containing the `latest_year` and `latest_week`.

**Note:** This single-query approach replaces any previous multi-step methods for improved efficiency and simplicity when finding the latest snapshot information.

### 6.2. Calculating Fill Rates (OOH vs. Budget/Actual)

Measures how much of a target (Budget/Actual `NET_SALES`) is covered by open OOH (`OOH`) as of a specific snapshot week.

#### 6.2.1. Concept

`Fill Rate % = (Sum of OOH OOH for Period / Sum of Target NET_SALES for Same Period) * 100`

#### 6.2.2. Data Sources & Matching

*   **Numerator (OOH):** `fna.fna_bronze.vw_gob_spencerorderbook`
    *   Filter by `WEEK_NO` (snapshot point-in-time), `SHIP_YEAR` (target period year).
    *   Apply standard filters (Section 5), `REPORT_TYPE` .
    *   **Use SQL aggregation `SUM(OOH)` (Section 6.6).**
*   **Denominator (Target):** `lft.bronze.dds_frwshp_jedox`
    *   Filter by `YEAR` (matching the OOH `SHIP_YEAR`), `SCENARIO` ('Budget' or 'Actual').
    *   *Note: Jedox data usually represents full-year values.*
    *   Apply standard exclusions (Section 5.1) if applicable based on `REPORT_OPERATING_GROUP_CODE_UPDATED` or `REPORT_OPERATING_GROUP_DESC_UPDATED` if available in Jedox.
*   **Matching Dimensions:** Ensure both queries are filtered or grouped by the *same* dimensions (e.g., `REPORT_OPERATING_GROUP_DESC_UPDATED`, `DIVISION_DESC`) for detailed fill rates.

#### 6.2.3. Example: Calculate 2025 OOH Fill Rate vs. 2025 Budget for 'Home And Accessories' as of Week 15 (Snapshot in 2025)

*Requires two queries; calculation done outside SQL.*

1.  **Get 2025 OOH Value (Numerator):**
    ```sql
    SELECT CAST(SUM(OOH) AS DECIMAL(38, 10)) AS OOH_Value_Base_CY
    FROM fna.fna_bronze.vw_gob_spencerorderbook
    WHERE REPORT_OPERATING_GROUP_DESC_UPDATED = 'Home And Accessories'
      AND WEEK_NO = 15 -- Specific snapshot week
      AND SHIP_YEAR = 2025 -- Orders shipping in 2025
    ```
2.  **Get 2025 Budget Value (Denominator):**
    ```sql
    SELECT SUM(NET_SALES) AS Budget_Value_Base_CY
    FROM lft.bronze.dds_frwshp_jedox
    WHERE REPORT_OPERATING_GROUP_DESC_UPDATED = 'Home And Accessories'
      AND YEAR = 2025 -- Matches OOH SHIP_YEAR
      AND SCENARIO = 'Budget'
      -- Add Standard Exclusions (Section 5.1) if applicable to Jedox context
      -- Ensure REPORT_OPERATING_GROUP_CODE_UPDATED is excluded if present in Jedox table
      -- Add other dimension filters if needed to match OOH query scope precisely
      ;
    ```
3.  **Calculate Fill Rate (Post-SQL):**
    *   `Fill Rate = (OOH_Value_Base_CY / Budget_Value_Base_CY) * 100` (Handle potential division by zero, Section 7.4).

#### 6.2.4. Example: Calculate 2024 OOH Fill Rate vs. 2024 Actuals for 'Home And Accessories' as of Week 15 (Snapshot taken in 2025)

*Compares prior year performance against Actuals, using a current snapshot week as the reference point for potentially still open historical orders (less common analysis, verify business need).*

1.  **Get 2024 OOH Value (Numerator):**
    ```sql
    -- Note: This query finds the value of orders scheduled for SY2024 that were *still active*
    -- in the Week 15 snapshot taken in 2025. This differs from the OOH *as of* 2024 Wk15.
    -- Confirm the business requirement carefully before using this pattern.
    SELECT CAST(SUM(OOH) AS DECIMAL(38, 10)) AS OOH_Value_Base_LY_Residual
    FROM fna.fna_bronze.vw_gob_spencerorderbook
    WHERE REPORT_OPERATING_GROUP_DESC_UPDATED = 'Home And Accessories'
      AND WEEK_NO = 15 -- Snapshot week (in 2025)
      AND SHIP_YEAR = 2024 -- Orders originally scheduled to ship in 2024
      -- Filtering by SHIP_YEAR=2024 targets the desired historical records.
    ```
    *Note: Interpretation of historical OOH viewed from a later snapshot needs careful consideration of business logic. Confirm what the comparison intends to measure.*
2.  **Get 2024 Actual Value (Denominator):**
    ```sql
    SELECT SUM(NET_SALES) AS Actual_Value_Base_LY
    FROM lft.bronze.dds_frwshp_jedox
    WHERE REPORT_OPERATING_GROUP_DESC_UPDATED = 'Home And Accessories'
      AND YEAR = 2024 -- Matches target historical Ship Year
      AND SCENARIO = 'Actual' -- Use 'Actual' for prior years
      -- Add Standard Exclusions (Section 5.1) if applicable
      -- Add other dimension filters if needed
      ;
    ```
3.  **Calculate Fill Rate (Post-SQL):**
    *   `Fill Rate = (OOH_Value_Base_LY_Residual / Actual_Value_Base_LY) * 100` (Handle division by zero, Section 7.4).

### 6.3. Comparing Year-over-Year (YoY) OOH

*Purpose: Compare OOH for the same snapshot week number but for different ship years.* **Requires SQL Aggregation (Section 6.6).**

#### 6.3.1. Example: Compare Wk 15 OOH for Ship Year 2025 vs. Ship Year 2024 for 'Home And Accessories'

*Assume the comparison point is Week 15 within the respective years.*

1.  **Get YoY_Difference (SY2025 Wk 15):**
*column **OOH** in the  `vw_gob_spencerorderbook` is Current_Year OOH amount, and we just need to apply filters to get the Curren_Year OOH amount in which week and which year. *
*column **LY_OOH** in the  `vw_gob_spencerorderbook` is Last_Year OOH amount, and we just need to apply filters to get the Last_Year OOH amount in which week and which year. *
*column **YoY_Difference** in the  `vw_gob_spencerorderbook` is YoY change, and we just need to apply filters to get the Last_Year OOH amount in which week and which year. *
    ```sql
    SELECT REPORT_CORPORATE_CUSTOMER_NAME, sum(YoY_Difference)
    FROM fna.fna_bronze.vw_gob_spencerorderbook
    WHERE REPORT_OPERATING_GROUP_DESC_UPDATED = 'Home And Accessories'
      AND WEEK_NO = 15
      GROUP BY REPORT_CORPORATE_CUSTOMER_NAME
      -- GROUP by REPORT_CORPORATE_CUSTOMER_NAME targets the sum of YoY_difference to the customer level. 
      ORDER BY sum(YoY_Difference) DESC
 -- ORDER by sum(YoY_Difference) DESC gives us the top increase customers. 
      LIMIT 10
 -- limit the top 10 customer with growth. 
    ```

3.  **Compare Results (Post-SQL):**
    *   Calculate YoY change: `Top Ten growth customers listed above`.
	* if asking for YoY decrease, change *ORDER By* to  `ORDER BY sum(YoY_Difference) AES`, and the results are top 10 decrease customers. 
	* Change the `select` clause by the users'ask, such as to `REPORT_OPERATING_GROUP_DESC_UPDATED`, or `REPORT_DIVISION_DESC`
*Purpose: Find which dimension members (e.g., Divisions, Customers) contributed most to the change between two periods.*


### 6.7 Lesson Learned: Performing YoY OOH Analysis with OG and Customer Drilldown

**Objective:** Analyze Year-over-Year (YoY) Order on Hand (OOH) changes for a specific week (e.g., comparing 2025 Wk15 vs 2024 Wk15), identifying key drivers at the Operating Group (OG) and Customer level. This integrates multiple concepts.

**Key Steps & Best Practices:**

1.  **Define Scope:** Target week (e.g., Wk15), Current Year (CY) Ship/Snapshot Year (e.g., 2025), Last Year (LY) Ship/Snapshot Year (e.g., 2024).
2.  **Data Source:** `fna.fna_bronze.vw_gob_spencerorderbook`.
3.  **SQL Aggregation (Critical - Section 6.6):** Use `SUM(OOH)` (cast to `DECIMAL(38, 10)`) and `GROUP BY` in SQL for *all* aggregations (Overall, OG-level, Customer-level). **Do not aggregate raw data client-side.**
4.  **Standard Filters (Section 5):** Apply consistent filters ( `WEEK_NO`, `SHIP_YEAR`) for YoY_Difference, WoW Difference. (Week Over Week Difference)
5.  **Overall & OG Level Analysis:**
    *   Query aggregated OOH totals (no `GROUP BY`) for CY and LY using identical filters.
    *   Query aggregated OOH totals `GROUP BY REPORT_OPERATING_GROUP_DESC_UPDATED` for CY and LY using identical filters.
    *   Calculate difference and YoY % change (handle division by zero - Section 7.4).
    *   Sort OGs by absolute difference.
7.  **Customer Level Drilldown (for Top Mover OGs):**
    *   Identify top 2-3 OGs with the largest absolute YoY change from Step 5.
    *   For each selected OG:
        *   Query aggregated OOH `GROUP BY REPORT_CORPORATE_CUSTOMER_NAME` for CY and LY, applying the same filters as Step 5 *plus* the specific `REPORT_OPERATING_GROUP_DESC_UPDATED` filter for that OG. **Refer to Appendix 8 for `REPORT_CORPORATE_CUSTOMER_NAME` warnings (high cardinality, potential truncation).**
        *   **Check Row Count:** Note the `.shape[0]` of the returned customer DataFrames (e.g., `df_cust_cy.shape[0]`). If near known tool limits (e.g., ~1000, see Section 7.6), truncation is possible.
        *   **Verification 2 (OG vs Customer Sum - Critical for High Cardinality):** Sum the retrieved customer-level aggregates for the OG (`df_cust_cy['OOH_Value_Base_CY'].sum()`) and compare against the verified OG total from Step 5/6. Repeat for LY. **This is crucial for detecting potential truncation of customer groups (Section 7.6, Manifestation 2).**
        *   Merge CY/LY customer data (`df_cust_merged = pd.merge(..., how='outer').fillna(0)`).
        *   Calculate absolute difference.
        *   Sort customers by absolute difference.
8.  **Reporting:**
    *   Structure: Overall Summary -> OG Performance -> Customer Drivers (for key OGs).
    *   **Crucially:** Explicitly state verification results (Step 6 & 7). If Verification 2 failed (Customer Sum != Verified OG Sum) or row counts strongly suggest truncation, clearly state that the customer-level analysis for that OG may be **incomplete** due to data retrieval limits (Section 7.6). Use cautious language (e.g., "Top identified customer contributors based on available data... Total change attributed to reported customers may not match OG total due to retrieval limits.").

## 7. Technical Tips & Troubleshooting

1.  **Check Query Output:** Immediately after fetching data (e.g., into a DataFrame `df`): check `df.head()`, `df.shape`, `df.columns`, `df.dtypes`. Ensure results are as expected and filters haven't excluded everything. Verify row counts (`df.shape[0]`) against expectations, especially for grouped queries (potential truncation, see Section 7.6).
2.  **SQL Aggregation & Verification:** If results seem incorrect, **first** re-verify your SQL query logic, filters, and **ensure you are using SQL aggregation** (`SUM()`/`GROUP BY`) as mandated in Section 6.6. **Second**, perform the total verification described in Section 6.6 Point 3. Failed verification often points to filter errors or retrieval limits (Section 7.6).
3.  **Data Type Conversion (Post-SQL):** Convert SQL types (Decimal, etc.) to standard Python types (`int`, `float`, `Decimal`) if needed for calculations, but do so carefully. Use Python's `Decimal` for high-precision arithmetic post-retrieval if required, as standard `float()` can lose precision.
    ```python
    # Example
    import decimal
    # Assuming df has 'Aggregated_Value' as object/Decimal type from SQL
    df['Aggregated_Value_Decimal'] = df['Aggregated_Value'].apply(decimal.Decimal)
    ```
4.  **Handle Division by Zero:** Use checks (`if divisor != 0 and divisor is not None:`) or safe methods (e.g., replace 0/NaN in denominator with `None` or a very small number if appropriate, or handle exceptions) before division when calculating ratios (YoY%, Fill Rate%).
5.  **Check Dictionary Keys / DataFrame Columns:** Avoid `KeyError` by double-checking names after operations like merging, pivoting, or renaming. Use `print(df.columns)` or `print(my_dict.keys())` for debugging.
6.  **Data Retrieval Tool Limits (e.g., `sql_read_enterprise`) (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Issue:** Tools used to execute SQL and retrieve results (like a hypothetical `sql_read_enterprise` function or similar connectors) may impose limits (e.g., an observed limit might be around 1000 rows/groups, but this can vary) on the data returned to the client environment (e.g., Python notebook).
    *   **Manifestation 1: Raw Data Truncation:** Fetching large, unaggregated datasets may return only a sample (e.g., the first N rows). **Never perform aggregations client-side on raw data retrieved this way if accurate totals are needed.** This is why Section 6.6 **mandates SQL aggregation** (`SUM`/`GROUP BY`) – it avoids this problem entirely by performing the calculation correctly on the full dataset within the database *before* results are sent back.
    *   **Manifestation 2: Aggregated Group Truncation:** Even when using correct SQL aggregation (`SUM()`, `GROUP BY`), the tool might *still* truncate the result set if the number of *distinct groups* returned by the `GROUP BY` clause is large (e.g., > 1000 customers). The SQL aggregation itself runs correctly on the database across all data, but the client receives an incomplete list of the resulting groups/rows.
    *   **Impact:** Analyses based on grouped results might be **incomplete** if the number of groups exceeds the tool's limit. This is especially relevant for high-cardinality dimensions like `REPORT_CORPORATE_CUSTOMER_NAME` (Appendix 8). The totals derived from summing the *truncated* grouped results client-side will not match the true total.
    *   **Mitigation & Detection:**
        *   **Always use SQL aggregation (Section 6.6).** This avoids Manifestation 1.
        *   **Always perform total verification (Section 6.6 Point 3, Section 6.7 Step 6 & 7).** Comparing the sum of retrieved groups against a direct total query is the **primary method to detect Manifestation 2**.
        *   Check the number of rows returned (`df.shape[0]`) for grouped queries. If it's near a suspected limit (e.g., 1000), be highly suspicious of potential group truncation.
        *   **Acknowledge limitations:** If verification fails for high-cardinality grouped queries, report that the analysis is likely **incomplete** due to retrieval limits impacting the number of returned groups. Clearly state this limitation in findings.

## 8. Appendix: Known Working Dimensions for Breakdowns

*Note: 'Home & Accessories' and 'Apparel' OGs are sometimes called 'Supply Chain Services (SCS)' (Section 2.2).*

### 8.1. 'Home And Accessories' Operating Group (`REPORT_OPERATING_GROUP_DESC_UPDATED = 'Home And Accessories'`)

*   `REPORT_DIVISION_DESC`
*   `REPORT_CORPORATE_CUSTOMER_NAME`
    *   **Warning:** High Cardinality (many unique customer names).
    *   **Mandatory:** Use SQL Aggregation (`SUM`/`GROUP BY`) as per Section 6.6.
    *   **Risk:** Subject to potential **aggregated group truncation** by retrieval tools (e.g., ~1000 group limit, see Section 7.6, Manifestation 2) even with SQL aggregation.
    *   **Verification Required:** Always verify the sum of retrieved customer aggregates against the verified OG total (See Section 6.7, Step 7). Failure indicates truncation.
    *   **Reporting:** If verification fails or truncation is suspected (e.g., row count near limit AND verification fails), explicitly state that customer-level analysis for this OG is **incomplete** due to retrieval limits.

### 8.2. 'Apparel' Operating Group (`REPORT_OPERATING_GROUP_DESC_UPDATED = 'Apparel'`)

*   *(Add known working dimensions here as they are discovered)*
*   `REPORT_CORPORATE_CUSTOMER_NAME`
    *   **Warning:** High Cardinality (many unique customer names).
    *   **Mandatory:** Use SQL Aggregation (`SUM`/`GROUP BY`) as per Section 6.6.
    *   **Risk:** Subject to potential **aggregated group truncation** by retrieval tools (e.g., ~1000 group limit, see Section 7.6, Manifestation 2) even with SQL aggregation.
    *   **Verification Required:** Always verify the sum of retrieved customer aggregates against the verified OG total (See Section 6.7, Step 7). Failure indicates truncation.
    *   **Reporting:** If verification fails or truncation is suspected (e.g., row count near limit AND verification fails), explicitly state that customer-level analysis for this OG is **incomplete** due to retrieval limits.

*(Add more Operating Groups and their known working dimensions as they are discovered, applying similar warnings and verification requirements for high-cardinality dimensions.)*
